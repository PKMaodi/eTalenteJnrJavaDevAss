# Task
Build a Spring Boot application that exposes a REST API for clients:
- Design the REST API endpoints, specifying the request and response formats for
  each endpoint.
- Implement the API endpoints using a Java framework such as Spring Boot
- Test the API endpoints thoroughly to ensure functionality, reliability, and
  performance.
- Document the API endpoints, input parameters, response formats, and error
  handling procedures

# The following validations must be applied on submission of file via the API:
- Implement robust error handling mechanisms to handle invalid requests, file processing
  errors, and other exceptional conditions.
- Log API requests, responses, and errors for monitoring and troubleshooting purposes.

1. All code should be written in a package com.enviro.assessment.grad001.yournameandsurname
2. From a technical perspective, as per commonly accepted best practice, each
record has a primary key called “id” that identifies it – this is a technical id, and
3. Please model and implement the interface in the way you consider to be the
best way from an Object Oriented perspective.
4. As we will be accessing a real database as part of this exercise, please
implement an in memory database (H2).
5. Your submission must be a Springboot application with a rest endpoints
